There are four possible types of provided test submissions for a
problem: "accepted", "time_limit_exceeded", "run_time_error", and
"wrong_answer", depending on which judgement the program is supposed
to get.  Each test submission is placed in a subdirectory
"submissions/<TYPE>" where <TYPE> is the type of the test submission.

At least one accepted solution is required. It is in general
recommended to supply at least one wrong answer and one time limit
exceeded solution (for test data coverage verification), but their
usefulness depends on the specific problem.
