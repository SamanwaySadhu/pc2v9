TROUBLESHOOTING

Note: If you are having troubles submitting files and/or clarifications,
change the permissions on the Team, JAR and jar/file_uploads folders to
be 777. The key part here is the write permission. The file submitted
is copied into the file_uploads directory in the JAR folder and it needs
to be able to write to it.
