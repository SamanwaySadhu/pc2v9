/**
 * This interface describes the PC<sup>2</sup> API view of a contest <I>Problem</i>. 
 * Each contest problem consists of a variety of attributes configured by the Contest Administrator, 
 * including
 * <ul>
 *    <li>The problem <I>name</i>;</li>
 *    <li>A flag indicating whether the problem includes a requirement for reading input data;</li>
 *    <li>The input data for the problem (referred to as the &quot;Judge's data file&quot;) if required;</li>
 *    <li>A flag indicating whether solutions to the problem should expect any input
 *          data to come from a file or from <I>stdin</i>;</li>
 *    <li>A flag indicating whether the problem includes a specification of the expected output for
 *          a correct solution to the problem (referred to as a &quot;Judge's answer file&quot;);</li>
 *    <li>A flag indicating whether the problem includes a <I>validator</i> (a program designed to
 *          accept as input (1) the output of a program submitted by a Team, and (2) a Judge's answer file, 
 *          and makes an automated determination as to whether the Team's program is a correct solution
 *          to the problem);</li>
 *    <li>The executable code for the validator;</li>
 *    <li>The command line necessary to invoke the validator.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This documentation describes the current <I>draft</i> of the PC<sup>2</sup> API, which is subject to change.
