Before starting, make sure that the /home/icpc/html folder is setup with the proper permissions;
that is, /home/icpc/html must be owned by  icpc.www-data and mode 775  (apache has to be able to
write to this folder to create symlinks).
The rest of the folders/files under /home/icpc/html just have to be readable.

To setup Apache2 to service the judgments:

1) Install apache2:  apt-get install apache2
2) Enable the CGI module: a2enmod cgi
3) Copy the judge.conf in this folder to: /etc/apache2/sites-available
4) Enable the site: a2ensite judge
5) You may want to disable the default site: a2dissite 000-default
6) Restart apache: apachectl restart
7) Create the /home/icpc/html/.htpasswd file with any user(s) you want to have access to the page:
   (as root):
        htpasswd -c /home/icpc/html/.htpasswd pc2 pc2password
   This would only allow user "pc2" with password: "pc2password" to access the:
   http://<server>/cgi-bin/alljudgments.py page.
