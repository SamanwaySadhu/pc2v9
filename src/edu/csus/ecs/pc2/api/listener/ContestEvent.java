/**
 * This class describes an Event representing the situation that some piece of contest configuration information has changed.
 * <p>
 * Each individual {@link ContestEvent} contains multiple fields which together act to describe the change which has occured.
 * First, every  {@link ContestEvent} contains an {@link EventType} (an enum element) identifying the general category of event -- 
 * whether it is related to changes in Accounts, Languages, Problems, etc.
 * <p>
 * Next, each {@link ContestEvent} contains detailed information which is event-type dependent.  For example, events of type
 * {@link EventType#PROBLEM} (related to changes in contest problem configuration) contain an object of type {@link edu.csus.ecs.pc2.api.IProblem} 
 * describing the problem configuration change which has occurred.
 * <P>
 * Clients implementing the PC<sup>2</sup> API {@link edu.csus.ecs.pc2.api.listener.IConfigurationUpdateListener} interface can 
 * determine the details of a contest configuration update event by first obtaining the {@link EventType} from the received event, and 
 * subsequently using the appropriate {@link ContestEvent} methods to obtain the configuration change details.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This documentation describes the current <I>draft</i> of the PC<sup>2</sup> API, which is subject to change.
