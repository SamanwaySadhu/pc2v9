The <B>API</b> package provides the facilities necessary for user-written Client applications to directly access 
a <A HREf="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2"> PC<sup>2</sup></a> Server.  The API would typically be used
by those wishing to write their own custom Clients; for example, specialized Team, Judge, or Scoreboard
modules.  Utilizing the facilities of the API package, such user-written modules can gain access to a wide variety of
contest data for the contest being run by the targeted PC<sup>2</sup> Server.
<P>
<I><B>NOTE:</b> while anyone can <I>write</i> a custom client module to access a PC<sup>2</sup> Server,
the ability to actually <I>connect</i> such a module to a Server is enforced at the <I>Server</i> side.  
In order for a Client to login to a Server and access its services, the Client must provide authentication
credentials in the form of a login account and password which has been created on the Server by the Contest
Administrator.  In addition, access provided to such a logged-in client is limited to the privileges
granted by the Contest Administrator to that account.</i>
<P>
Using the facilities in the API package requires that a PC<sup>2</sup> Server already be running, and that
the custom Client making use of the API be provided with a <font face=courier> pc2v9.ini </font> file just as
with any other PC<sup>2</sup> client.  The API package documentation assumes the reader is already familiar 
with these concepts; see the separate PC<sup>2</sup> Contest Administrator's Guide for additional details.
<P>
Writing a custom Client using the PC<sup>2</sup> API involves three basic steps:
<ol>
	<li> Establishing a <i>server connection</i>
	<li> Logging in to the server via the server connection by providing valid authentication credentials.  Successfully 
			logging in to a server provides access to an object of type <code>IContest</code>, a representation of the
			contest being controlled by the server.
	<li> Invoking the various <code>IContest</code> methods to access server operations and obtain contest data.
</ol>
The following paragraphs provide examples of how each of these basic steps is performed.
