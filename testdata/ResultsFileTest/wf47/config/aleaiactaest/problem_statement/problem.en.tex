\problemname{Alea Iacta Est}

You play a game with multiple fair six-sided dice.
Each die's face displays a single symbol.
The objective of the game is to roll the dice and create a valid word from the symbols on top of each die.
If you cannot form a word, you may reroll the dice for another attempt.

Suppose there are five dice: one of them contains letters \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D}, \texttt{E}, and \texttt{P}
(abbreviated as \texttt{ABCDEP}), and the other dice contain letters \texttt{AEHOXU}, \texttt{AISOLR},
\texttt{ABCDEF}, and \texttt{ABCSCC}. The first roll yields the following letters
on the tops of respective dice: \texttt{P}, \texttt{X}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{E}, and \texttt{S}. As it is impossible to
arrange these letters into a valid word, you decide to keep the \texttt{P}, \texttt{S}, and \texttt{E},
and reroll the other dice, in an attempt to make words like
\texttt{PARSE}, \texttt{PAUSE}, \texttt{PHASE}, \texttt{POISE}, \texttt{PROSE}, \texttt{PULSE}, or \texttt{PURSE}. The two dice yield \texttt{E} and
\texttt{A}, resulting in the following five letters: \texttt{P}, \texttt{E}, \texttt{A}, \texttt{E}, and \texttt{S}. You still cannot
think of a valid word, so you decide to keep four letters and reroll only the
last die, which has three sides with letter \texttt{C}. By doing so, there is a $50\%$ chance
that it will be possible to make a final valid word: {\texttt{PEACE}},
as shown in Figure \ref{alea:dice}.

When you roll a die, it lands on any one of its faces with equal probability.
What is the expected number of rolls needed to make a valid word, assuming you
use an optimal strategy?

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains two numbers $d$ and $w$, where $d$ ($1 \leq d
\leq 6$) is the number of dice and $w$ ($1 \leq w \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) is the number of
valid words in the dictionary. The following $d$ lines each have $6$ symbols,
one for each face of the die.
The final $w$ lines contain $w$ distinct valid words in the dictionary. Every word has
exactly $d$ symbols.

All symbols in the input are either uppercase letters (\texttt{A}--\texttt{Z})
or digits (\texttt{0}--\texttt{9}).

\section*{Output}

If it is possible to make a valid word, output the expected number of rolls needed to
make a valid word when using an optimal strategy.  Otherwise, output \texttt{impossible}.
Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
